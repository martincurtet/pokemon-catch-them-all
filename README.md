# Pokémon Smash or Pass

Pokémon Smash or Pass is an online browser game hosted on ... and using data from this [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Inspiration came after Markiplier released [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gys9oDZj-MY) and friend asked for a tool to recreate it. This 'joke' project serves as experience in web programming and a first online public project.

### Features

The player is able to select the generations he wants to review and then play in order or in a random mode. Pokémon selected for 'Smash' will be displayed in a final downloadable result as well as relevant statistics.
